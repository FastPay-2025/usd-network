## 📋 Abstract

USDNetwork (USDTN) is a next-generation, USD-pegged stablecoin designed to deliver financial privacy, accessibility, and multi-chain operability. Built to operate across major blockchain ecosystems such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Tron, and Solana, USDTN provides fast, low-cost, and censorship-resistant stable value transfer without compromising usability.
